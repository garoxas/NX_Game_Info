Stable build https://github.com/garoxas/NX_Game_Info/releases  

# Features
- Windows, macOS and Linux compatible (Command Line Interface)
- NSP, XCI, NRO and installed titles on Switch SD card
- Game files structure (Scene Release, CDN Rip, Authoring Tool, Converted from other formats)
- NCA signature to verify official Nintendo titles. Unmodified titles should pass this verification, although titles converted from other formats will not

# How to
NX Game Info uses `prod.keys`, `title.keys` and `console.keys` in the format as defined in https://github.com/garoxas/LibHac/blob/NX_Game_Info/KEYS.md and `hac_versionlist.json` from [tagaya CDN server](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Network#tagaya)

 - *prod.keys*: Mandatory keys includes `header_key`, `aes_kek_generation_source`, `aes_key_generation_source`, `key_area_key_application_source` and `master_key_00`. Failing to provide these keys will make the application quit
  `master_key_##`, `key_area_key_application_##` and `titlekek_##` will also be necessary to decrypt titles with higher MasterKey requirement
 - *title.keys*: Optional, required for `Permission` check if `.tik` file not available
 - *console.keys*: Optional, `sd_seed` key required for `Open SD Card` feature
 - *hac_versionlist.json*: Optional, required for `Latest Version` feature

The application will look for these files at the following locations (other file locations will follow wherever `prod.keys` file was found)

 - Directory of the executable file (.exe) for Windows or (.app) for macOS
 - `$HOME/.switch` e.g. C:\\Users\\_yourname_\\.switch for Windows, /Users/_yourname_/.switch for macOS or /home/_yourname_/.switch for Linux

 `Export` menu supports exporting current list to either `CSV` or `XLSX`. For `CSV` file, default delimiter to use is `comma ( , )` and user defined character can be set in `user.settings` by specifying the delimiter character in `CsvSeparator` field

 Compressed NCA is not supported, but there is an option to make the application accept `XCZ` and `NSZ` file extension by setting `NszExtension` field in `user.settings`. Please note that issues related to these file extensions will not be supported
